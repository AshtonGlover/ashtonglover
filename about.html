        <p class="about-text">
          Hi, my name is Ashton Glover and I am a junior studying computer
          science at Brown University. Within computer science, I am most
          interested in AI projects, especially computer vision related
          projects, and backend web development. I recently started working more
          on frontend design related work, and building this portfolio allowed
          me to showcase a wide variety of my skill sets. I am mostly interested
          in Software Engineering positions.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">
          Outside of class, I am pretty involved in the CS department through
          various TA positions that I have held, as well as being a member of
          Hack@Brown where I will be one of the co-directors for this upcoming
          year.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
          Beyond academics, I am a big fan of sports, especially soccer (Real Madrid fans not welcome here) as well as exploring. I love wandering around Providence and seeing new places, as well as just general traveling and hiking.
